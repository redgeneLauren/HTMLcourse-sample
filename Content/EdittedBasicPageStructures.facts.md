### Facts for HTML Basic Page Structure

HTML stands for `Hypertext Markup Language`, the most widely used language for writing web pages.

`Hypertext` refers to the way web pages are linked together.

HTML is a `Markup Language` that tells the web browser how to structure a text document using `tags`.

`Tags` consists of angle brackets `<>`.

The opening tag `<`  starts an HTML element and the closing tag `/>` with a forward slash character ends the HTML `element`.

An `element` is a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags.

Contents are texts or other elements contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

Code:
```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>The document title</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>This is the Heading of the page</h1>
      <p>This where the page content will be written</p>
   </body>
</html>
