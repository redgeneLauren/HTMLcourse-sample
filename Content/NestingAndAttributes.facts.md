### Facts for Nesting, Identation and Alignment

1. Nesting

    - In an HTML code, HTML elements are contained within other HTML elements which is essential in building a web page. 

    - These HTML elements that are contained within other HTML elements are called `nested elements`.

    - HTML code is `nested` in a proper order. The opening tag `<>` is always followed by a closing tag `</>`.

    - When an HTML code is not properly nested it may affect the visual appearance of the web page. The HTML code will not render properly due to HTML elements and tags are out of place.

    - The code below shows a proper nested HTML.

Code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Nesting</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Lesson 2: Nesting</h1>
        <p>Nesting HTML elements</p>
    </body>
</html>  
```

- An open tag for `<html>` is paired with a closing tag `</html>`

- Inside the `<html></html>` are the `<head></head>`, `<title>HTML Nesting</title>`, `<body></body>`, `<h1>Lesson 2: Nesting</h1>` and `<p>HTML elements contain other HTML elements</p>` elements. 

- After the opening tag `<head>` contains the element `<title>HTML Nesting</title>` and ends with a closing a tag `</head>`. 

- After the closing tag `</head>` is the opening tag `<body>` which contains the elements  `<h1>Lesson 2: Nesting</h1>` and `<p>HTML elements contain other HTML elements</p>` and ends with a closing tag `</body>`. 

2. Indentation and Alignment

    - Indentation in HTML coding enhances the readability of the code. 

    - Indentation should reflect logical structure. An element should match the same indentation level as the opening tag.

    - Indent the contents of the element between the opening tag and the closing tag.

    - Do not use unnecessary indentation and blank lines, only indent elements base on logical structure of indentation level. 

Code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Nesting</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Lesson 2: Nesting</h1>
        <p>HTML elements contain other HTML elements</p>
    </body>
</html>  

```

- Proper nesting, indentation and alignment should be observed in using HTML.
