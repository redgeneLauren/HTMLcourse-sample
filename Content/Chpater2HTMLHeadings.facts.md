### Facts for Chapter 2 HTML Headings

1. HTML Headings
    
    HTML has six levels of headings: 
     - `<h1></h1>` tag is used for main headings. 
     
     - The contents for `<h1></h1>` tag appears to be the largest.

    - `<h2></h2>` is used for subheadings.

    - Any further sections under subheadings are indicated by `<h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`.
    
    - The contents for `<h6></h6>` tag appears to be the smallest. 

    - Users can adjust the size of the text in their browser and control the style and color using `CSS styles`. 

    - Heading attributes are the same with the paragraph attributes.

    ```html

    <h1> This is the main heading </h1>
    <h2> This is the 2nd level of subheading </h2>
    <h3> This is the 3rd level of subheading </h3>
    <h4> This is the 4th level of subheading </h4>
    <h5> This is the 5th level of subheading </h5>
    <h6> This si the 6th level of subheading </h6>

    ```
