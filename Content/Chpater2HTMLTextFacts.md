     - The contents for `<h1>` tag is the largest.

    - `<h2>` is used for subheadings

    - Any further sections under subheadings are indicated by `<h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`.
    
    - The contents for `<h6>` tag are the smallest. 

    Users can adjust the size of the text in their browser and control the style and color using CSS styles.

    <h4> This is the 4th level of subheading </h4>
    <h5> This is the 5th level of subheading </h5>
