### Facts for Using HTML Headings

1. HTML Headings
    
    HTML has six levels of headings: 

     - `<h1></h1>` tag is used for the main headings. 
     
     - The content for `<h1></h1>` tag appears to be the largest.

    - `<h2></h2>` tag is used for the subheadings.

    - Any further sections under subheadings are indicated by `<h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`.
    
    - The content for `<h6></h6>` tag appears to be the smallest. 

    - Only make use of the `HTML headings tags` for headings sections only. 

    Code: 
    ```html

    <h1> This is the main heading </h1>
    <h2> This is the 2nd level of subheading </h2>
    <h3> This is the 3rd level of subheading </h3>
    <h4> This is the 4th level of subheading </h4>
    <h5> This is the 5th level of subheading </h5>
    <h6> This si the 6th level of subheading </h6>

    ```

    Output: 

    <h1> This is the main heading </h1>
    <h2> This is the 2nd level of subheading </h2>
    <h3> This is the 3rd level of subheading </h3>
    <h4> This is the 4th level of subheading </h4>
    <h5> This is the 5th level of subheading </h5>
    <h6> This si the 6th level of subheading </h6>

    - Attributes can be used in the `heading` element.

     - Users can also adjust the size of the text in their browser and control the style and color using `CSS styles`.

    <h1 style="font-family: courier; color: orange"> This is the main heading </h1>

    ```
