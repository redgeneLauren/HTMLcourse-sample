### Facts for HTML Basic Page Structure

HTML stands for `Hypertext Markup Language`, the most widely used language for writing web pages.

`Hypertext` refers to the way web pages are linked together and a `Markup Language` tells the web browser how to structure a text document using `tags`.

`Tags` consists of angle brackets `<>`.

The opening tag `<`  starts an HTML element and the closing tag `/>` with a forward slash character ends the HTML `element`.

An `element` is a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

Contents are text or other elements contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

Code:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>This document title</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>This is the Heading</h1>
      <p>This is the Paragraph</p>
   </body>
</html>

```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` defines the document type and the HTML version.

- `<html></html>` encloses the HTML document.

- `<head> </head>` defines the title of the document.

- `<title></title>` sets the title of the web page. Contents of the `title` tag is seen in the browser tab of the the web page.

- `<body></body>` specifies the actual content to display on the web page. Anything written inside the `body` tag will appear in the web page. 

- `<h1></h1>` sets the heading of the document. 

- `<p></p>` sets the paragraph of the page.
