### Facts for HTML Basic Page Structure

1. HTML terminologies

    - HTML stands for `Hypertext Markup Language`, the most widely used language for writing web pages.

    - HTML is a `Markup Language` that tells the web browser how to structure a text document using `tags`.

    - `Hypertext` refers to the way web pages are linked together.

    - HTML is composed of elements that structure the webpage and define its content.

2. Tags and Element

    - Tags are element names enclosed in angle brackets `<>`.

    - The opening tag `<>` starts an HTML element and the closing tag `</>` ends the HTML `element`.

    - The Closing tag has a forward slash character `/` after the left angle bracket `<`.

    - An `element` is a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and text or media it contains.

    - Contents are texts or other elements contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>This is the Heading of the document</h1>
      <p>Page content will be written here</p>
   </body>
</html>
