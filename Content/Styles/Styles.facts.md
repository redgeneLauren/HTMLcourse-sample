### Facts for HTML Styles

1. Style 

    - `HTML styles` is one of the most common attribute used in HTML. It adds style to HTML elements.

    - In most HTML attributes, `HTML styles` appear as `name-value pairs` separated by an equal sign `=` and are written within the opening tag `<>` of an element, after the element's name.

    Code:
    ```html
    <p style="color: red">Paragraph with an attribute style</p>

    ```

     - The `style` attribute allows cascading style sheet `(CSS)` rules to be written inside an element and when `CSS` is written using the style attribute, it's called an `inline style`. 

    - The `inline style` directly affects the element they are written in. 

    Code:
    ```html
    <p style="color: red">Paragraph with an attribute style</p>

    ```
    Output:

    <p style="color: red">Paragraph with an attribute style</p>

    - The `value` of the `style` attribute is written as a CSS property value pair: `style="property: value"`. Each property value are seperated by a `:` colon. 

    - `"color: red; font-family: courier"` -  these are a few of the `CSS property value pairs` from the `style` attribute. Each `pair` are seperated by a `;` semi-colon.
