### Facts for Nesting and Attributes

1. Nesting

    - In an HTML code, HTML elements are contained within other HTML elements which is essential in building the web page. 

    - These HTML elements that are contained within other HTML elements are called `nested elements`.

    - HTML code is `nested` in a proper order. The opening tag `<>` is always followed by a closing tag `</>`.

    - The code below shows a proper nested HTML.

Code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Nesting</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Lesson 2: Nesting</h1>
        <p>HTML elements contain other HTML elements</p>
    </body>
</html>  
```

- An open tag for `<html>` is paired with a closing tag `</html>`

- Inside the `<html></html>` is the `<head></head>`, `<title>HTML Nesting</title>`, `<body></body>`, `<h1>Lesson 2: Nesting</h1>` and `<p>HTML elements contain other HTML elements</p>` elements. 

- The `<head>` contains the element `<title>HTML Nesting</title>`. 

- After the closing tag `</head>` is the `<body>` which contains the elements  `<h1>Lesson 2: Nesting</h1>` and `<p>HTML elements contain other HTML elements</p>`. 

2. Indentation and Alignment

    - Using indentation in HTML coding enhances the readability of the code. 

    - Indent the contents of the element between the opening tag and the closing tag.

    - Align the same parent elements and child elements. 

Code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Nesting</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Lesson 2: Nesting</h1>
        <p>HTML elements contain other HTML elements</p>
    </body>
</html>  

```
- The `<html>` tag is a parent of `<head>` and `<body>` tags. Notice how the `<head></head>` and `<body></body>` are indented from the opening `<html>` tag.

- The `<head>` tag is a parent of the `<title></title>` tag which are indented from the opening of the `<head>` tag. 

- The `<body>` tag is aligned to the closing tag `</head>` which means they are both a child of the `<html>`.

- The `<body>` tag is a parent of the `<h1></h1>` and `<p></p>` which are indented from the opening tag `<body>`.

- Proper `nesting` should be observed in using HTML.
