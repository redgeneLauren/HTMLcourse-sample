### Facts for Nesting and Attributes

1. Nesting

    - HTML code should be `nested` in a proper order, the opening tag `<>` is always followed by a closing tag `</>`.

    - An open tag for `<html>` is paired with a closing tag `</html>`

    - Inside the `<html></html>` tag are other nested tags to build up the html code.

    - Proper `nesting` should be observed in using HTML.

    - The code below shows proper nested HTML.

    Code:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
        </head>
            <body>
            <h1></h1>
            <p></p>
            </body>
      </html>  

1. Attributes

    - Attributes are used to add additional information and define the characteristics of an `HTML element`. 

    - Attributes are written inside the opening tag `<>` and are made up of two parts: `name` and `value` which are separated by an `=` equal sign.

    - The code below shows the usage of an attribute.

Code:
```html

<p lang="eng-us"; style="color: red">My first HTML code inside a paragraph using attributes</p>
    
```
Output:
     
<p lang="eng-us"; style="color: red">My first HTML code inside a paragraph using attributes</p>

- The attribute `name` in the example code above are `lang` and `style`. 

- `name` is the property you want to set for the `HTML element`. It should be written in lowercase.

- The attribute `value` in the example code above are `eng-us` and `color:red`. 
    
- `value` is the value of the property to be set and always placed within quotations `""`

- Different attributes have different values.
    
- Most attribute `values` are `pre-defined` or follow a stipulated format.
