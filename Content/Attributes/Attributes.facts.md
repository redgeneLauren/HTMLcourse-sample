### Facts for Attributes

1. Attributes

    - In HTML, all HTML elements can contain an `attribute`.

    - An attribute defines the characteristics or property of an HTML `element`. 

    - Attributes are placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element. 

    - Attributes are made up of two parts, `name` and `value` which are seperated by an `=` equal sign.
 
    - The attribute `name` is the `property` to set and the attribute `value` is the `value of the property` to be set.

    - Attribute names and attribute values are written in lowercase. 

    - The code below shows how attributes are written in an HTML code.  

Code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Lesson3: Attributes</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
        <p lang="eng-us"; style="color: red">Paragraph with Attributes</p>
    </body>
</html> 

```
     
Output:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Lesson3: Attributes</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
        <p lang="eng-us"; style="color: red">Paragraph with Attributes</p>
    </body>
</html> 

- The attribute `name` in the example code above are `lang` and `style`. 

- Attribute `name` indicates the kind of extra information you are supplying about the content of the `element`. It should be written in lowercase.

- The attribute `value` in the example code above are `eng-us` and `color:red`. 
    
- Attribute `value` is the setting for the declared attribute of `name`. It should be placed inside the double quotes `“ ”` . 

- Different `attributes` have different `values`.
    
- Most attribute `values` are `pre-defined` or follow a stipulated format.
