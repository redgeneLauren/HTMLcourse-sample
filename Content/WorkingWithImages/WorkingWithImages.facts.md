### Facts for Working with Images

Images can be embeded in an HTML document. In embedding images to the page you will use the empty element `<img>`.

`<img>` is referred to as an empty element because it is an element that does not require a closing tag. 

The example code shows how an image is embeded in an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Working with Images</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src="HTML.png" alt="" title="">
    </body>
</html>

```

Output:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Working with Images</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src="HTML.png" alt="an logo of HTML" title="This image ref">
    </body>
</html>
