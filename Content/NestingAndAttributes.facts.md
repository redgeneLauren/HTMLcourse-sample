### Facts for Nesting and Attributes

1. Nesting

- In a typical HTML code, HTML elements are contained within other HTML elements. 

- These elements that are contained within other HTML elements are called `nested elements`

- HTML code is `nested` in a proper order, the opening tag `<>` is always followed by a closing tag `</>`.

- The code below shows a proper nested HTML.

Code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Nesting</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Lesson 2: Nesting</h1>
        <p>HTML elements contain other HTML elements</p>
    </body>
</html>  
```
In the code above, an open tag for `<html>` is paired with a closing tag `</html>`

Inside the `<html></html>` element are other elements that also contain other elements to build up the html code.

Proper `nesting` should be observed in using HTML.

1. Attributes

    - Attributes are used to add additional information and define the characteristics of an `HTML element`. 

    - Attributes are written inside the opening tag `<>` and are made up of two parts: `name` and `value` which are separated by an `=` equal sign.

    - The code below shows the usage of an attribute.

Code:
```html

<p lang="eng-us"; style="color: red">My first HTML code inside a paragraph using attributes</p>
    
```
Output:
     
<p lang="eng-us"; style="color: red">My first HTML code inside a paragraph using attributes</p>

- The attribute `name` in the example code above are `lang` and `style`. 

- `name` is the property you want to set for the `HTML element`. It should be written in lowercase.

- The attribute `value` in the example code above are `eng-us` and `color:red`. 
    
- `value` is the setting of the property to be set and always placed within quotations `""`

- Different attributes have different values.
    
- Most attribute `values` are `pre-defined` or follow a stipulated format.
